Radar Navigation integration
First, I need to understand principles of radar communication integration. (Transmit the position of the radar transmitting station to the user)
Second, TDOA/FDOA estimation and spatial spectrum estimation(MUSIC and ESPRIT).(ALL is based on array signal processing).
Third, resolve position coordinates by geometric relations.
